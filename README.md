# MagicaVoxelPalettes
HSL Palettes for MagicaVoxel

### Painting with 256 colors

In this age it is so rare to encounter palette limits. 32 bit color has become ubiquitous. 
Each file in MagicaVoxel has its own palette and all objects use the same palette. 

A nice palette should have a wide variety of colors and shades and make them easy to pick . 
This palettes are loosely based in the Atari palettes.
