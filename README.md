HSL Palettes for MagicaVoxel

### Painting with 256 colors

In this age it is so rare to encounter palette limits. 32 bit color has become ubiquitous. 
Each file in MagicaVoxel has its own palette and all objects use the same palette. 

A nice palette should have a wide variety of colors and shades and make them easy to pick . 
This palettes are loosely based in the Atari palettes. 

### HSL 
HSL stands for hue saturation and lighting. 
Hue indicates the color of the spectrum
Saturation indicates how gray a color is. 
Lighting indicates if a color is a pure color , or light ( the whiteness) , or dark ( the blackness) 
This is the most intuitive way I have found to organize all posible colors. 

### HSL_2 
This is a palette with 15 colors , 8 lighting levels and 2 gray levels plus 16 colors for grayscale.
